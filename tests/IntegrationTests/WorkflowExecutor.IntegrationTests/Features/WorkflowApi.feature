@IntergrationTests
Feature: WorkflowApi

API to interact with WorkflowRevisions collection

@GetWorkflows
Scenario: Get all clinical workflows from API - Single workflow
    Given I have an endpoint /workflows
    And I have a clinical workflow Basic_Workflow_1
    When I send a GET request
    Then I will get a 200 response
    And I can see the expected workflows are returned

@GetWorkflows
Scenario: Get all clinical workflows from API - Multiple workflows
    Given I have an endpoint /workflows
    And I have a clinical workflow Basic_Workflow_2
    And I have a clinical workflow Basic_Workflow_3
    When I send a GET request
    Then I will get a 200 response
    And I can see the expected workflows are returned

@GetWorkflows
Scenario: Get all clinical workflows from API - No workflows
    Given I have an endpoint /workflows
    When I send a GET request
    Then I will get a 200 response
    And I can see the expected workflows are returned

@WorkflowPagination
Scenario Outline: Get all clinical workflows from API - Test pagination
    Given I have an endpoint /workflows/<pagination_query>
    And I have <amount> clinical workflows
    When I send a GET request
    Then I will get a 200 response
    And Pagination is working correctly for the <pagination_count> workflows
    Examples:
    | pagination_query           | amount | pagination_count |
    | ?pageSize=1                | 15     | 15               |
