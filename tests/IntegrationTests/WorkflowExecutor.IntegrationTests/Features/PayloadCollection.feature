@IntergrationTests
Feature: PayloadCollection

Tests around the payload collection

@PatientDetails
Scenario: Payload collection will be populated with patient details after receiving a Workflow Request when patient metadata exists
    Given I have a clinical workflow Basic_Workflow_1
    When I publish a Workflow Request Message <workflowRequestMessage> with artifacts <objects> in minio
    Then A payload collection is created with patient details <patientTestData>
    And I can see <workflowInstance> Workflow Instance is created
    Examples:
    | workflowRequestMessage                     | objects                  | patientTestData | workflowInstance |
    | Basic_AeTitle_Payload_Collection_Request_1 | full_patient_metadata    | Full_Patient    | 1                |
    | Basic_Non_Existant_Request                 | partial_patient_metadata | Partial_Patient | 0                |

@PatientDetails
Scenario: Payload collection will be populated with null patient details after receiving a Workflow Request when patient metadata is blank
    Given I have a clinical workflow Basic_Workflow_1
    When I publish a Workflow Request Message Basic_AeTitle_Payload_Collection_Request_2 with artifacts null_patient_metadata in minio
    Then A payload collection is created with patient details Null_Patient
    And I can see 1 Workflow Instance is created

@PatientDetails
Scenario: Payload collection will be populated with null patient details after receiving a Workflow Request when patient metadata is missing
    Given I have a clinical workflow Basic_Workflow_1
    When I publish a Workflow Request Message Basic_AeTitle_Payload_Collection_Request_3 with artifacts no_patient_metadata in minio
    Then A payload collection is created with patient details Null_Patient
    And I can see 1 Workflow Instance is created

@WorkflowInstanceDetails
Scenario: Payload collection will be populated with workflow instance id after receiving a Workflow Request when workflow is matched
    Given I have a clinical workflow Basic_Workflow_1
    When I publish a Workflow Request Message Basic_AeTitle_Payload_Collection_Request_1 with artifacts full_patient_metadata in minio
    Then A payload collection is created with 1 workflow instance id

@WorkflowInstanceDetails
Scenario: Payload collection will be populated with workflow instance ids after receiving a Workflow Request when multiple workflows are matched
    Given I have a clinical workflow Basic_Workflow_1
    Given I have a clinical workflow Basic_Workflow_2
    When I publish a Workflow Request Message Basic_AeTitle_Payload_Collection_Request_1 with artifacts full_patient_metadata in minio
    Then A payload collection is created with 2 workflow instance id

@WorkflowInstanceDetails
Scenario: Payload collection will not be populated with workflow instance ids after receiving a Workflow Request when no workflows are matched
    Given I publish a Workflow Request Message Basic_AeTitle_Payload_Collection_Request_1 with artifacts full_patient_metadata in minio
    Then A payload collection is created with 0 workflow instance id
